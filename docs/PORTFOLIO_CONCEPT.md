# World-Class AI/ML Portfolio — Concept & Blueprint

**Audience:** Recruiters and engineers at top AI companies.  
**Goal:** "This candidate is special" within 60 seconds.  
**Positioning:** High-potential AI engineer, not generic junior web dev.

---

## 1. Full site structure

### 1.1 Hero (above the fold)

**Purpose:** One-line identity + proof you're serious about AI. Recruiters decide in seconds whether to scroll or close.

**What appears:**
- **Headline:** One sharp line that says "AI engineer" and "building" (not "aspiring").
- **Subheadline:** Role + one concrete AI/ML signal (e.g. GenAI project, PyTorch, current focus).
- **Primary CTA:** "See my AI work" or "Explore projects" — not "Contact me" (that comes later).
- **Secondary:** Small "Currently learning" pill or line (e.g. "Diving into RAG & agentic systems") — signals curiosity and direction.
- **Optional hook:** A single interactive element (e.g. a minimal "Ask about me" that scrolls to About, or a subtle terminal-style line that types your focus).

**Why recruiters care:** They're scanning for "AI", "ML", "building", and evidence of focus. Generic "full-stack" or "software engineer" gets skipped.

---

### 1.2 About (narrative, not bio)

**Purpose:** Tell the story of *why AI* and *how you think*. Differentiate from juniors who "also know Python."

**What appears:**
- **2–3 short paragraphs:** Transition from support/QA → building ML systems; what you're optimizing for (applied AI, production ML, LLMs); one line on learning velocity (e.g. shipping SwellSight while working full-time).
- **Signals:** "I care about models in production, not just notebooks" or "I want to work on systems that use LLMs responsibly."
- **Optional:** One bold line — e.g. "Looking for my first role where I can ship ML end-to-end."

**Why recruiters care:** AI hiring managers want to see intentionality and clarity of direction, not a generic "I like tech."

---

### 1.3 Projects (AI-first showcase)

**Purpose:** Prove you can ship. Lead with the one project that screams "AI/ML"; structure others so ML-relevant work is visible.

**What appears:**
- **Featured (hero project):** SwellSight — full card with: problem, approach (CV + GenAI), stack (PyTorch, etc.), outcome/learning, link to code or write-up. Optional: "Why I built this" or "What I'd do differently" (thought process).
- **Other projects:** Cards with clear "ML/AI" or "Systems" labels. For each: 1-line problem, 1-line what you did, tech, link. No filler.
- **Project deep-dive (optional per project):** Expandable or separate page: architecture, decisions, metrics if any, "What I learned."

**Why recruiters care:** One strong ML project beats five generic CRUD apps. Thought process shows maturity.

---

### 1.4 Experimental Lab

**Purpose:** Show continuous learning and builder mindset. Makes you memorable and signals "this person experiments."

**What appears:**
- **Section or page:** "Lab" or "Experiments."
- **Items:** Small builds, weekly explorations, course projects, Kaggle/notebooks, small tools. Each: title, 1-line description, tech, link (GitHub/Colab/demo).
- **Tone:** "Here’s what I’m tinkering with" — authentic, not braggy. Mix of finished and in-progress.
- **Ideas:** RAG toy, small fine-tune, CLI tool for dataset inspection, visualization of a paper, prompt-playground.

**Why recruiters care:** Shows you don’t wait for permission to build. Labs/experiments are a strong differentiator for junior AI roles.

---

### 1.5 AI / Positioning section (optional but powerful)

**Purpose:** Explicitly state direction and what you want. Reduces ambiguity.

**What appears:**
- Short block: "Where I'm headed: AI engineering, applied ML, LLM-based systems. I want to work on models in production and learn from people who ship at scale."
- Or integrate this into About; either way, the message must be visible.

**Why recruiters care:** They can mentally match you to open roles. Clear intent = easier yes.

---

### 1.6 Contact & CTA

**Purpose:** One clear next step. No friction.

**What appears:**
- **Headline:** "Let's talk" or "Open to opportunities."
- **One primary action:** Email or Calendly. Not five options.
- **Resume:** Keep the existing Resume mode toggle — recruiters who want a doc get it.
- **Optional:** "I'm especially interested in [applied AI / ML infra / LLM products]. If that's your team, say hi."

**Why recruiters care:** Low friction = more replies. One clear CTA beats a crowded footer.

---

## 2. Unique & impressive features

### 2.1 Implemented / recommended

| Feature | What it is | Why it works |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| **Resume ↔ Portfolio toggle** | Already there. Keep it. | Recruiters who want "document" get it; others get the story. |
| **"Currently learning" line** | One line in hero or nav: e.g. "Currently: RAG & agentic systems." | Signals direction and curiosity without a whole section. |
| **Project thought process** | On SwellSight (and optionally others): "Why I built this" / "What I'd do differently." | Shows judgment, not just implementation. |
| **Lab / Experiments** | Dedicated section or page with small builds and explorations. | Memorable; proves you build outside assignments. |
| **AI-first copy** | Every section leads with AI/ML intent and evidence. | You get categorized as "AI candidate" in 10 seconds. |
| **Single strong CTA** | One primary action in Contact: email or Calendly. | No decision fatigue; higher conversion. |

### 2.2 "Wow" moments (pick 1–2)

- **Minimal terminal in hero:** One line that "types" your current focus (e.g. `> focus = "applied_ml"`). Subtle, not gimmicky.
- **Scroll-triggered reveal:** As recruiter scrolls, sections appear with short, confident lines (no long paragraphs above the fold).
- **Lab as "living" section:** "Last experiment: [date] — [one line]." Shows you're active.
- **Easter egg:** e.g. Konami code or click on your name reveals a short "Looking for X role" message. Fun without being unprofessional.

### 2.3 What to avoid

- No generic "I'm passionate about technology."
- No long paragraphs before any hook.
- No listing 20 skills; curate to AI/ML + one stack.
- No fake "AI assistant that knows you" unless you actually built it and can demo it.

## 3. AI-focused positioning

### 3.1 How to present ML work (even if small)

- **Name the problem:** "Ocean wave analysis for maritime safety" not "ML project."
- **Stack explicitly:** PyTorch, HuggingFace, OpenCV, etc. So recruiters can pattern-match.
- **Outcome or learning:** "Explored diffusion-based generation for wave fields" or "Learned to balance dataset size vs. model complexity."
- **"What I'd do next":** One line (e.g. "Productionize with ONNX, add evaluation metrics") shows you think beyond the notebook.

### 3.2 How to look like high-potential AI engineer

- **One production-adjacent signal:** Support at Jifiti = you've seen production systems. Say it: "I've debugged live systems; I want to build the models behind them."
- **Learning in public:** Lab + "Currently learning" = growth mindset.
- **Clarity of goal:** "Targeting applied AI / ML engineering" on the page. No hedging.

### 3.3 What AI recruiters want to see

- Evidence you can code (repos, projects).
- Evidence you care about ML (projects, stack, narrative).
- Evidence you learn fast (Lab, current focus, thought process).
- Low risk: clear communication, no red flags (typos, generic copy).

### 3.4 Signals of intelligence & curiosity

- Specificity (SwellSight, not "an AI project").
- Reflective questions ("What I'd do differently").
- Directed learning ("Currently: X").
- One bold, honest line ("Looking for my first role where I ship ML end-to-end").

## 4. Experimental / Lab section (structure & content)

### 4.1 Structure

- **Title:** "Lab" or "Experiments" or "Building in the open."
- **Intro line:** "Small builds and weekly explorations. Not always polished — always learning."
- **Format:** Cards or list. Each: Title | 1-line description | Tech | Link (GitHub / Colab / demo).
- **Optional:** "Last updated" or "Latest: [experiment] on [date]."

### 4.2 Content ideas (authentic)

- SwellSight (if not in main Projects) or a "SwellSight v2" iteration.
- RAG or retrieval toy (e.g. "Ask my docs" on a small docset).
- Fine-tune experiment (e.g. small model on a niche task).
- Dataset or metric visualization (from a paper or course).
- CLI tool for inspecting datasets or model outputs.
- Prompt playground or eval on a small set of prompts.

Keep 3–6 items; quality over quantity. "In progress" is fine if labeled.

---

## 5. Recruiter psychology

### 5.1 What makes them stay

- **Immediate clarity:** "This is an AI/ML candidate" in the first 10 seconds.
- **One strong proof point:** One project they can remember (SwellSight).
- **Low friction:** Easy to find resume, one clear CTA.
- **Personality:** One or two lines that feel human (e.g. "Building in the open" or "Learning in public").

### 5.2 What makes them close

- Generic "software engineer" with no AI angle.
- Walls of text before any hook.
- No clear "what I want" or "what I built."
- Broken links, typos, or empty sections.

### 5.3 How to create "this candidate is special"

- **Specificity:** Named project, named stack, named goal.
- **Narrative:** Why AI, why now, what you're learning.
- **Proof:** Lab + projects + resume mode = you're serious and organized.
- **One memorable line:** Either in hero or About (e.g. "I want to work on models in production").

## 6. UI/UX direction

### 6.1 Visual style

- **Dark primary:** Keep dark theme for portfolio mode; feels focused and modern.
- **Accent:** Cyan/emerald stays; add one more accent for "current focus" or CTAs (e.g. same cyan, slightly brighter on hover).
- **Density:** Not dense. Generous whitespace; one idea per section. No sidebar clutter.

### 6.2 Layout

- Single-column, full-width content (max-width for readability). Sections clearly separated.
- Hero: headline + subhead + CTA + optional "Currently learning." No long paragraph.
- About: 2–3 short blocks. Projects: featured card then grid. Lab: grid or list. Contact: one block, one CTA.

### 6.3 Typography

- **Headlines:** Bold, slightly large. One font (sans) for consistency; optional serif for a single "statement" line.
- **Body:** Readable size; line height 1.5–1.6. Muted color for secondary text.
- **No:** Playful or comic fonts; more than two typefaces.

### 6.4 Animations

- **Scroll:** Fade-in or short slide-up on section enter. Subtle (e.g. 0.3–0.4s).
- **Hover:** Light border or glow on cards; no bouncy or distracting motion.
- **Avoid:** Auto-playing carousels, heavy parallax, or anything that delays content.

### 6.5 Vibe

- **Elite engineer:** Clean, confident, specific. Feels like someone who ships.
- **Not template:** Avoid "Hi, I'm X" and stock imagery. Your voice, your projects, your goal.

## 7. Actual copy examples

### Hero

- **Headline:**  
  **"Building systems that learn."**  
  Or: **"From support to models — building toward AI engineering."**

- **Subheadline:**  
  "Software Engineer shipping production systems today; building GenAI & ML projects on the side. B.Sc. CS (HIT). Targeting applied AI & ML engineering roles."

- **CTA (primary):**  
  "See my AI work" (scroll to Projects) or "Explore projects".

- **Currently learning (small):**  
  "Currently: RAG, agentic systems & production ML."

### About

- **Opening:**  
  "I'm Shalev — a software engineer with a sharp turn toward AI. I've spent the last few years in production support and QA, which taught me how systems fail and how to fix them. Now I'm focused on building the kind of systems that learn: applied ML, GenAI, and LLM-based products."

- **Proof + direction:**  
  "I built SwellSight (GenAI for ocean wave analysis) to go from idea to working model. I'm not just running tutorials — I'm shipping small end-to-end ML projects and pushing myself toward production ML and LLM applications."

- **Closing / CTA:**  
  "I'm looking for my first role where I can ship ML end-to-end and learn from teams that build at scale."

### Projects (SwellSight card)

- **Title:** SwellSight  
- **Tag:** GenAI · Computer Vision  
- **Short:** "Generative model for ocean wave analysis — combining computer vision and deep learning for maritime and environmental use cases."  
- **Thought process (optional):** "Why I built this: to go end-to-end from problem definition to a real model. What I'd do next: add proper evaluation metrics and explore deployment (ONNX / small batch API)."

### Contact

- **Headline:** "Let's talk."  
- **Line:** "I'm actively looking for roles in AI engineering, applied ML, and LLM-based systems. If that's your team — say hi."  
- **CTA:** [Email: Shalevatsis@gmail.com] or [Book a short call].

### Resume mode (keep existing)

- No change to document; ensure it still opens from nav and prints cleanly.

---

## 8. Tech suggestions

- **Keep:** Next.js 14, Tailwind, Framer Motion, static export for GitHub Pages.
- **Consider:** 
  - Framer Motion for scroll-triggered section reveals (already in use).
  - Optional: `react-type-animation` or a tiny custom hook for one-line "typing" in hero (minimal terminal).
- **No need (for now):** Backend, DB, or real "AI assistant" unless you build and maintain it. A static, fast, well-written site beats a half-baked chatbot.
